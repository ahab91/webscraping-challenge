# webscraping-challenge

## Overview

In this challenge, I used Splinter and BeautifulSoup in a Jupyter Notebook file to scrape data from two URL's. In Part 1, I scraped and stored the titles and preview text of each article listed at the bottom of the website. In Part 2, the code scrapes data from the table of Mars weather facts in the URL to find interesting stats and develop graphs charting data from the table.
